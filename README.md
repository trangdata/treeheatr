#### *Your decision tree may be cool, but what if I tell you you can make it hot?*

## Changes in treeheatr 0.2.0

The first argument of `heat_tree()`, `data` is now replaced with `x`,
which can be a dataframe (or tibble), a party (or constparty) object
specifying the precomputed tree, or partynode object specifying the
customized tree. `custom_tree` argument is no longer needed.

## Install

Please make sure your version of R &gt;= 3.5.0 before installation.

You can install the released version of **treeheatr** from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages('treeheatr')
```

Or the development version from GitHub with remotes:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes') # uncomment to install devtools
remotes::install_github('trang1618/treeheatr')
```

## Examples

### Penguin dataset

These data were collected and made available by [Dr.Â Kristen
Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

Classification of different types of penguin species.

``` r
library(treeheatr)

heat_tree(penguins, target_lab = 'species')
```

### Wine recognition dataset

Classification of different cultivars of wine.

``` r
heat_tree(wine, target_lab = 'Type', target_lab_disp = 'Cultivar')
```

## How to Use

**treeheatr** incorporates a heatmap at the terminal node of your
decision tree. The basic building blocks to a **treeheatr** plot are
(yes, you guessed it!) a decision tree and a heatmap.

-   The decision tree is computed with `partykit::ctree()` and plotted
    with the well-documented and flexible
    [**ggparty**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggparty/) package.
    The tree parameters can be passed to **ggparty** functions via the
    `heat_tree()` and `draw_tree()` functions of **treeheatr**. More
    details on different **ggparty** *geoms* can be found
    [here](https://github.com/martin-borkovec/ggparty).

-   The heatmap is shown with `ggplot2::geom_tile()`. The user may
    choose to cluster the samples within each leaf node or the features
    across all samples.
