\usage{
compute_tree(
  x,
  data_test = NULL,
  target_lab,
  task = c("classification", "regression"),
  feat_types = NULL,
  label_map = NULL,
  clust_samps = TRUE,
  clust_target = TRUE,
  custom_layout = NULL,
  lev_fac = 1.3,
  panel_space = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Dataframe or a `party` or `partynode` object representing a custom tree.
If a dataframe is supplied, conditional inference tree is computed.
If a custom tree is supplied, it must follow the partykit syntax:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partykit/vignettes/partykit.pdf}

\item{data_test}{Tidy test dataset. Required if `x` is a `partynode` object.
If NULL, heatmap displays (training) data `x`.}

\item{target_lab}{Name of the column in data that contains target/label information.}

\item{task}{Character string indicating the type of problem,
either 'classification' (categorical outcome) or 'regression' (continuous outcome).}

\item{feat_types}{Named vector indicating the type of each features,
e.g., c(sex = 'factor', age = 'numeric').
If feature types are not supplied, infer from column type.}

\item{label_map}{Named vector of the meaning of the target values,
e.g., c(`0` = 'Edible', `1` = 'Poisonous').}

\item{clust_samps}{Logical. If TRUE, hierarchical clustering would be performed
among samples within each leaf node.}

\item{clust_target}{Logical. If TRUE, target/label is included in hierarchical clustering
of samples within each leaf node and might yield a more interpretable heatmap.}

\item{custom_layout}{Dataframe with 3 columns: id, x and y
for manually input custom layout.}

\item{lev_fac}{Relative weight of child node positions
according to their levels, commonly ranges from 1 to 1.5.
1 for parent node perfectly in the middle of child nodes.}

\item{panel_space}{Spacing between facets relative to viewport,
recommended to range from 0.001 to 0.01.}
}
\value{
A list of results from `partykit::ctree` or provided custom tree, including
fit, estimates, smart layout and terminal data.
